### Installation & Usage

1. **Download EchoRewind executable:** Obtain the latest release of EchoRewind from the [release page](https://github.com/C-Luddy/EchoRewind/releases).

2. **Download the second to last EchoVR release for Quest:** [EchoVR release for Quest](https://oculusdb.rui2015.me/id/2215004568539258). (Also download OBBs for later use)

3. **Place all files in the same directory:** Ensure that the EchoRewind executable, a `config.json` file containing server details, and the EchoVR game APK are placed in the same directory.

4. **Patch the game client:** Drag and drop the EchoVR game APK onto the EchoRewind executable.

5. **Sideload the patched APK:** After patching, sideload the newly patched APK and the previously downloaded OBB file onto your Quest using a tool such as [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/) and launch as normal.

### Configuration
